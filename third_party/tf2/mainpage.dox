\b tf2 is the second generation of the tf library.

This library implements the interface defined by tf2::BufferCore.

There is also a Python wrapper with the same API that class this library using CPython bindings.

\section codeapi Code API

The main interface is through the tf2::BufferCore interface.  

It uses the exceptions in exceptions.h and the Stamped datatype 
in transform_datatypes.h. 

\section conversions Conversion Interface

tf2 offers a templated conversion interface for external libraries to specify conversions between
tf2-specific data types and user-defined data types. Various templated functions in tf2_ros use the
conversion interface to apply transformations from the tf server to these custom datatypes.

The conversion interface is defined in tf2/convert.h.

Some packages that implement this interface:

- tf2_bullet
- tf2_eigen
- tf2_geometry_msgs
- tf2_kdl
- tf2_sensor_msgs

More documentation for the conversion interface is available on the <A HREF="http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Migration/DataConversions">ROS Wiki</A>.
