    \brief Alters the colors of the source item by applying an overlay color.

    The effect is similar to what happens when a colorized glass is put on top
    of a grayscale image. The color for the overlay is given in the RGBA format.

        This property allows the effect output pixels to be cached in order to
        improve the rendering performance.

        Every time the source or effect properties are changed, the pixels in
        the cache must be updated. Memory consumption is increased, because an
        extra buffer of memory is required for storing the effect output.

        It is recommended to disable the cache when the source or the effect
        properties are animated.

        By default, the property is set to \c false.
